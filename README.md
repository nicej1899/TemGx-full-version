# TemGX: Generating Temporal Graph Explanations for Temporal Graph Neural Networks
## Overview

This repository provides the full-verision of TemGX, a method for generating temporal graph explanations of predictions made by temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs). TemGX features a bi-level framework that extracts instance-level explanations (local subgraphs) and then learns a global dynamic Bayesian network to capture the temporal evolution of these explanatory nodes.
